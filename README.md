# Babel-Express-Mongoose-Eslint-Rest-Boilerplate


This is based on https://github.com/KunalKapadia/express-mongoose-es6-rest-api

The differences from the above boilerplate are:
* No use of gulp, all scripts are native
* Using Better NPM Run for environment variable management
* Include babel server side building
* Add eslint (v2)
